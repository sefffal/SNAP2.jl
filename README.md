The Signal to Noise Analysis Pipeline, the Next Generation! (tm)

This repository contains a re-write of the SNAP pipeline, designed to be more modular and inspectable.

Current support:
* NIRC2
* LOCI/KLIP/TLOCI
* SNR-Opt
* Multi-target SNR Opt

Unsupported (see SNAP 1):
* IRDIS
* SPHERE IFS
* GPI
* NIRI

## Instructions: General Process

The SNAP2 pipeline uses a template `.toml` file to select files for calibration. After that, each function takes file paths or shell "glob" patterns, eg. "n*.fits". 
Most steps only operate on new or changed files. This allows them to be used for live-processing.
If you want to re-run a step from scratch, pass `force=true`.

All steps generate temporary FITS files, so make sure that you have plently of disk space before starting!

After calibration, each step appends a new suffix to the end of the filename. For example,
`myseqname.n0101.cal.bgsub.medsub.rotnorth.fits` has been calibrated, background-subtracted, median-subtracted, and rotated North-up.

Operations that reduce several files take a "glob" pattern, eg. `myseqname.n*.cal.fits`. If the operation produces a single output file, eg due to stacking, the output filename will be the "glob" pattern with any `*` replaced by `_`, eg. `myseqname.n_.cal.stacked.fits`.

##  Instructions: Pre-Processing

1. Create a template `.toml` file with the following information. This specifies which frames to use for eg. darks, flats, etc. There are also a few parameters to control pre-processing steps like background subtraction. An example is listed at the bottom of this page.

2. Run calibration
```julia
calibrate_nirc2("myseqname.toml",) # see example at the bottom of the page.
# Optional: generate a movie
seq2gif("cal/myseqname.*.cal.fits.gz")
```

3. Find the rough star position (updates headers). The arguments are "file pattern", "PSF template path", and "max star distance from centre (px)" for the search.
```julia
# Optional: generate a cropped movie.
findstar_nirc2("cal/myseqname.*.cal.fits.gz", "cal/unsat.psf-cored.fits.gz", 140,) 
seq2gif("cal/myseqname.*.cal.fits.gz", crop=100) 
```

4. Run background subtraction. 
```julia
bgsub("./myseqname.toml",)
seq2gif("cal/myseqname.*.cal.bgub.fits.gz", clims=Percent(95)) # Optional: generate a cropped movie.
```

5. Registration. Re-align the images so that the star is centred in all frames. Uses a template PSF and cross-correlation. If you are registering a coronagraphic sequence, the template can have the middle removed so that it only searches the surrounding speckle pattern.
```julia
register("cal/myseqname.*.cal.bgsub.fits.gz", "cal/unsat.psf-cored.fits.gz",)
# Optional: generate a cropped movie
seq2gif("cal/myseqname.*.cal.bgsub.reg.fits.gz", crop=150, clims=px -> quantile(px, 0.95) .* (-0.5, 1)) 
```

6. Flux normalization. 
```julia
fluxnorm("cal/myseqname.*.cal.bgsub.reg.fits.gz")
# Optiona: generate a movie
seq2gif("cal/myseqname.*.cal.bgsub.reg.fluxnorm.fits.gz", crop=150, clims=px -> quantile(px, 0.999) .* (-0.5, 1)) 
```
